        <br>
     Shooting stars <br> 
    Darting through the sky <br> 
    One fallen <br> 
    Dropping to the green <br> 
    looking up I see a bright star  <br> 
    Watched you hit the ground    <br> 
    I couldn't believe my shooting star<br> 
    Was a fallen angel <br> 
    Took care of you I did <br>
    When our eyes connected <br> 
    A burning passion arose <br>
    The thorns of a bouquet of roses<br>
    Holding on to you stung like a bee <br>
    Letting you go hurt more <br>
    I know you had to go Home<br>
    But I have a feeling where ever you I go <br>
    Ill always be with you
